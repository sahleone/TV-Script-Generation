# TV-Script-Generation
In this project, I will be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

## Data
The data is located in `Seinfeld_Scripts.txt`. Feel free to swap it out try something else  
(The hypperparameters might need updating ).
